Base 'Standard'
====

A Pure Development Theme for WordPress with added Theme Options Panel

Base 'Standard' is a starter theme for WordPress developed by @benbuildsstuff extended from 'Base' to include a user-based Theme Options Panel in the dashboard. This allows for custom site logos, favicons and CSS to be added by the site administrator and/or user easily and simply. There are also options for easily adding social accounts and blog options. 

Like 'Base', Base 'Standard' has no markup, no css (apart from a simple reset).
